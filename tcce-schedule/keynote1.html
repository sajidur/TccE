 <h4>4IR : Challenges and Opportunities of Bangladesh</h4>
 <hr>
<h3>Abstract:</h3>
<p align="justify">
The human civilization has been experiencing a very vibrant industrial revolution, which we have not seen before because of its uniqueness, especially the necessary decentralization to tackle our everyday problems, starting from traffic management, water management, public administration, manufacturing and many more. Consequently, it has created an opportunity to reduce cost of any service, increased the productivity as well as the quality of services. At the same time, it has brought numerous challenges, especially how the people will be equipped with necessary skills to implement the very essence of this era, which is driven by science, engineering, technology as well as the information and communication technology. To take advantage of these opportunities as well as to tackle the challenges, we need a planned maneuvering in the higher education system of our country starting from its teaching, learning and research approaches. Therefore, a plethora of changes need to be initiated in the higher education sector of our country. By taking the above issues into account, I will talk about a comprehensive plan to enable us to understand the relevant areas where these changes should be applied so that an education system guided by the concept of 4IR can also be advocated and implemented in the higher education system of our country. Eventually, the vision 2041 as well as the Delta Plan 2100 of the present government can be realized.
Dr. Md. Sazzad Hossain is a distinguished professor, researcher, academic teaching advisor with extensive experience in ICT sector and a writer. Currently, he is working as a full-time member of University Grants Commission of Bangladesh. He is also a Director of the Board of Directors of Bangladesh Communication Satellite Company Ltd (BCSCL). Dr. Sazzad is a masterly instructor in ICT field with enormous knowledge on the subject matter. He joined as a professor as well as Head of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh in December 2009. He received his PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Portland State University, Oregon, USA which is one of the top-ranking universities of the world. His doctoral dissertation in Quantum Computing takes background and ideas from several fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, computer engineering and biology. He completed his Master in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the same university in USA. He received his Bachelor of Science in Electrical System Network Engineering from Moscow Technical University (Popularly known as Moscow Power Institute), Moscow, Russia. He completed his S.S.C from Faujdarhat Cadet College and H.S.C from Chittagong College. Dr. Sazzad taught several advanced courses, such as Introduction to Quantum Computing, VLSI Design, Artificial Intelligence and Human-Robot Interaction. He also lent his teaching and research experiences in many universities and institutes as a visiting faculty/researcher/guest speaker. He has twenty-six (26) years of experience in Information Technology. He has served as a consultant to several nationally and internationally renowned ICT companies, government agencies and organizations. His research interest includes Quantum computing, quantum algorithms, quantum entanglement, decoherence, natural computing, fault-tolerant computing, theoretical computer science, Nano Technology, Low Power VLSI Design, Reversible logic, Software Engineering, Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Human-Robot Interaction, Renewable Energy and Solar PV Cell. His work is motivated by the theory of Darwinian Evolution, how the Darwinian Evolution evolved from some earlier evolution which could be only chemical and physical? Did Darwinian Evolution exist before the first living cell arrived? Can something be created from nothing? Therefore, he believes that Darwinian Evolution results from Quantum Mechanical Evolution and maybe other evolutions (chemical, physical) that were created in between. It is found in Nature that the structure of all organisms has been designed to provide the capability of solving a multitude of complex problems for both survival and growth, through instinctual, experiential, and intellectual means. Even as environmental conditions change, it is the continuous adaptation process of natural organisms adjusting to their environment, through evolutionary processes, which sustains life. Nature itself has proven its development of robust system design. Based on his research findings, over 50 papers have been published in peer-reviewed international journals and conference proceedings. He is popular with the readers of science and technology books for his recently published book titled “অদৃশ্য প্রযুক্তি” (Invisible Technology) which caught readers’ attention since its availability. He is also the author of the book named “Programming in C”.
